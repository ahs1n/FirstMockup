    <h1>Introduction to the Applied Visual Design Challenges</h1>
    <p>Visual Design in web development is a broad topic. It combines typography, color theory, graphics, animation, and page layout to help deliver a site's message. The definition of good design is a well-discussed subject, with many books on the theme.</p>
    <p>At a basic level, most web content provides a user with information. The visual design of the page can influence its presentation and a user's experience. In web development, HTML gives structure and semantics to a page's content, and CSS controls the layout and appearance of it.</p>
    <p>This section covers some of the basic tools developers use to create their own visual designs.</p>
